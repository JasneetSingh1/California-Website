                        Census. San Francisco
                        was officially incorporated as a city in 1850, shortly after the California Gold Rush. The city
                        is considered to be
                        an urban area, with a bustling downtown and numerous neighborhoods that offer a variety of
                        cultural experiences. San
                        Francisco has a reputation for being an expensive place to live, and the average income level is
                        higher than that of
                        many other cities in the state. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income
                        in San Francisco
                        was $123,859 in 2019, which is significantly higher than the state median of $80,440.

                        temperatures and frequent fog.
                        The city is located on the coast of northern California, which has a Mediterranean climate
                        characterized by cool,
                        wet winters and dry summers. In San Francisco, temperatures typically range from the mid-50s to
                        the mid-60s
                        Fahrenheit (around 12-18Â°C) throughout the year. However, the city is also known for its
                        frequent fog, which can
                        roll in from the ocean and blanket the city in a cool mist. The fog is most common in the summer
                        months, when warm
                        air from inland regions meets the cooler ocean air. Despite the fog, San Francisco enjoys plenty
                        of sunshine, with
                        an average of over 260 sunny days per year.
